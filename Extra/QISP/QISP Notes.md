### Information Security Governance
- Set of responsibilities and actions exercised by Board of Management of an organisation
- Goal: **Align** strategic direction of IS activities with business strategy
	- Ensure that IS risks **managed adequately**
	- Use resources efficiently to **achieve organisation's objectives**
	- Ensure that **resources and processes properly protected**

### Classical Information Security Objectives
| Objective       | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Confidentiality | Ensure information not disclosed or made available to unauthorised individuals, entities or processes                                                                         |
| Integrity       | Protect information and information systems from unauthorised changes                                                                                                         |
| Availability    | Ensures information or assets is accessible and usable whenever demanded by unauthorised authority                                                                            |
| Accountability  | Ensures that actions of individual can be traced back to that individual<br>Enables organisations to determine who has executed what action, how and when was action executed |
| Non-repudiation | Ensures individual or entity cannot deny previous commitments or actions<br>(Can be achieved through digital signatures)                                                                                                      |


### Risk Assessment
- Should be undertaken to **identify physical, environmental security threats**
- Determine appropriate associated controls to be **implemented in organisation to counter threats**
- When performing risk assessment, complexity and risk level associated with electronic information assets and facilities environmental systems need to be considered
- Should be on top of traditional physical security such as security guards, looks and fences

### Risk Monitoring 
- Management should ensure organisation's risk profile is updated accordingly
- Can be achieved through periodic risk assessments, security reviews (penetration testing) and audits
- Organisation should be proactive in risk monitoring and acting to response to new risks in timely manner
- Use of indicators in larger organisations can help monitor status of risks more effectively
- Address this element by including:
	- **Training and awareness programme** (help others recognise risk involved)
	- **Communication of IS policies, standards and procedures**

### Vulnerabilities
> Weaknesses that can be exploited in **People, Processes and Technology**
> - If exploited, can result in damage or harm

- Examples of vulnerabilities:
	- **Unpatched** software and/or operating systems
	- **Unencrypted** transmission of data
	- **Non-compliance** or enforcement of policies
	- **Weak** protection or poor network design

### Information Security Risk Management
> **Risk treatment** involves prioritisation, evaluation and implementation of appropriate risk-reducing  controls recommended based on risk assessment

- Risk can be treated based on following options:

| Option       | Explanation                                                             |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Avoidance    | Completely avoided risk by eliminating the root cause of consequences   |
| Mitigation   | Reduce or lower the risk by implementing appropriate controls           |
| Transference | Transfer risk to another party e.g. purchase of insurance               |
| Acceptance   | Accept residual risk after employing and exhausting first three options |

### Information Classification
- Process of classifying data or information assets 

> **Aim**: Prioritise effort and resources required to protect data and information assets
- Organisation should assess relative importance of various information systems based on following criteria:
	- Nature of function
	- Criticality of information
	- Sensitivity of information
	- Information asset value
- Organisations usually classify information in terms of confidentiality
- **Typical system of levels of confidentiality:**
	- Confidential (senior management)
	- Restricted (most employees)
	- Internal (all employees)
	- Public Information (everyone)

- **Issues of information classification:**

| Issue                    | Description                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Multiple Classifications | Comply with multiple laws and regulations                                                                                                  |
| Internal Resistance      | Face internal resistance from some individuals when engaging them to begin discovery                                                       |
| Over-classification      | Occurs when security classification mapped to access controls which must not happen when only one person is classifying information assets |
| Coverage                 | Will never really show whether or not all information assets have been discovered                                                                                                                                           |

### Acceptable Use Policy (UAP)
- AUP details permitted system uses, user activities and consequences of non-compliance
- Users often required to agree to UAP before being granted access rights to a system
- **Human Resource Departments** need to define and enforce Acceptable User Policy
- Outline standards on how employees may use Internet or link device that touches organization's IT infrastructure

### Cyber Hygiene
- Best practices:
	- Installing antivirus software to scan for viruses
	- Using firewalls to stop unauthorized users from getting information
	- Restrict privileged access to authorised personnel
	- Updating apps, web browsers, and OSs on all devices regularly
	- Keeping hard drives clean by reformatting and wiping them
	- Changing passwords and using multifactor authentication
	- Review server and application port settings
	- Conduct security awareness training

- Framework for governing and managing enterprise IT to support organisations in the development, implementation and continuous improvement and monitoring of good IT-related governance and management practices

#### COSO
> **COSO** -> Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission
- Guidance to Executive Management and governance entities on the following critical aspects: 
	- organisational governance
	- business ethics
	- internal control
	- enterprise risk assessment
	- fraud
	- financial reporting

### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- To protect individuals fundamental rights and freedoms
	- Particularly their right to protection to their personal data
- Key privacy and data protection requirements of GDPR include the following:
	- Requiring consent of subjects for data processing
	- Anonymizing collect data to protect privacy
	- Providing data breach notifications
	- Safely handling transfer of data across borders
	- Requiring certain companies to appoint data protection officer to oversee GDPR compliance

> **Important to note:**
> - GDPR applies to each member state of the EU aiming to create more consistent protection of consumer and personal data across EU countries
> - Any company that sells goods and services to EU citizens regardless of location is subject to regulations

- EU mandates mandate baseline set of standards for companies that handle EU citizen's data to better safeguard processing and movement of citizen personal data

## Physical Security, Business Continuity and Audit
> **Definition**
> - Physical and environmental security provide protection for for physical assets and infrastructure of organisation
> - Extend from buildings, information processing facilities, information systems and storage facilities to mission critical or sensitive data

- IS is important to organisational needs
	- Ensures that information resources are protected and available to organisation when required
- **Layer Defence Model**
	- Physical controls should work together in tiered architecture
	- Level of security increases as attacker moves into the layers
	- Prevents or delays attackers from gaining access to assets

### Business Continuity Management (BCM)
> BCM helps organisation establish resilient response framework to tackle identified threats and potential impact

#### Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
- Management level examination of impact qualitatively and quantitatively if potential disruption of business operations and processes occur\

**Objectives:**
- Assist management in understanding impact associated with possible disruptions
- Identify and prioritise critical business processes, applications and systems
- Analyse the impact
- Determine recovery objectives

### System Audit Plan
> **Goals**:
> - Ensure that IT controls protect corporate assets, ensure data integrity and operate effectively to achieve organisation's goals and objectives

- Information Systems Audit Strategy
- Formalise Audit Plan
- Type of IS Audit
- Evaluation of Findings
- Communicating Audit Results
- Follow-up Activities
- Audit Documentation

**Objectives:**
- Evaluation of organisation processes and information systems are in place
- Identify gaps in IT system and management
- Identify risks to information assets
- Ensure compliance with IT specific laws policies and standards
- <u>Important to develop audit programme for target audit areas</u>

## Security Architecture and Engineering

### Cryptography
**Objectives:**
- Ensure confidentiality of information
- Protect integrity of information against alteration
- Authenticate source of information
- Prevent unauthorised access to data or cipher text
- Prevent repudiation by sending and receiving parties during message exchange

#### Key Management Principles
- Should be automated to eliminate manual steps that are prone to human error
- No key should appear in clear outside of cryptographic devices to ensure secrecy of key
- Key must be randomly chosen from entire key space to eliminate pattern in which key is chosen
- Key Encrypting Key (KEK) must be separate from Data Encrypting Key (DEK)
	- Key used to encrypt keys should not be used to encrypt data
	- Exposure and use should be limited
	- KEKs should be stored very securely and separate from DEKs
	- KEKs can be organised into a hierarchy (master KEK used to encrypt, intermediate KEKs stored encrypted only)
	- Keys with long life must be used sparsely to minimise exposure and reduce possibility of attack

#### Key Management Interoperability (KMIP)
> KIMP standardises the communication between cryptographic clients that consume keys and key management systems that create and manage those keys

- Leverages other standards like TLS whenever possible and focuses on problem of interoperable messages between cryptographic clients and key management systems
- Allows organisations to deploy single enterprise key management infrastructure to manage all keys in organisation
- Allows specific key management environments to communicate with other key management systems outside their environments

### Security Architecture
| Component                      | Description                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Enterprise                     | Collective of functional organizations or units that is composed of multiple domain and networks |
| Architecture                   | Highest level concept of system in its operating environment                                     |

- Define whether compliance with any control framework is necessary
- Justify need for security measures

**Security Architecture Frameworks:**
- O-SCOA Framework for Secure Collaboration-Oriented Architecture
- Open Security Architecture (OSA)
- SABSA

### IS Risk Assessment
- Assess risk exposure and vulnerabilities
- Prioritise risks with risk profile
- Define requirements that incorporates control to address risk
	- Incorporate standards, laws and expectations
- In general, need to perform the following:
	- Impact Analysis
	- Risk Determination
	- Controls Recommendation
- Design and develop preventive, detective, respond and recovery controls

## Operation and Infrastructure Security
### Zero-Trust Network
- Network-centric security model based on castle-and-moat concept
	- Accessing the outside network is difficult
	- Everyone inside network is trusted by default

> **Problem:** once attackers gain access to internal network they become trusted like authorised personnel

- In zero-trust network, no one is trusted by default inside or outside the network
- Verification is required from everyone gaining access to resources on network
- Access to more secure resources requires additional stronger authentication

### Service Transition

| Services Validation and Testing            | Ensures that deployed releases and resulting services meet customer expectations and verify that IT operations can support new service                                   |
| Knowledge Management                       | Aim: Gather, analyse, store and share knowledge and information within organisation                                                                                                                                                                         |

### Virtualisation Security
- Creates multiple VMs
- Evaluate, implement, monitor and manage security within virtualisation infrastructure
	- Includes processes like securing VMs, virtual network and other virtual appliances with attacks and vulnerabilities surfaced from underlying physical device
- Two common concepts in virtualisation security:
	- **Segmentation** - specific network resources only accessible to specified applications and users
	- **Isolation** - allows discrete applications and workloads to operate independently on the same network

### Increase Threats of Malware
- Emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) allows parties to exploit vulnerabilities in computerised devices connected to the Internet to gain valuable information
- Devices that were once not computerized e.g. refrigerators, washing machines, TVs turned into IoT devices by connecting them to the Internet with software not designed with security in mind

### Types of Malware

### Security Zoning 
1. **Demilitarized Zone**
	- Network between internal network and Internet that provides layer of security and privacy
	- DMZ enables external users to access information that organisation deems necessary and will not compromise any internal organisational information
2. **Intranet**
	- Subnet portion or segmented zone of internal network that uses web-based technologies
3. **Extranet**
	- Subnet or segmented zone of public portion of company's infrastructure that grants resource access by partners and resellers that have proper authorisation and authentication

### Access Control Models
> Identifying person doing specific job authenticating them by looking at their identification and giving them only the key to door or computer they need access to and nothing more

#### Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
- System controls access to resources
- When subject request access to object
- System examines user identity and access rights and compares to access permissions of object
- System permits or denies access

#### Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
- Owner of object controls who and what may access it
- Access is at owner's discretion
- Example: shared file server where access permissions are administered by owners of its contents

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Access permissions granted to roles instead of persons
- Simplifies management in complex system of many users and objects
- Makes changes much easier

### Data Recovery
| Backup Type          | Description                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Full Complete Backup | Both system files and data files included in full backup                                            |
| Incremental Backup   | Only includes files changed since the last incremental backup                                       |
| Differential Backup  | Only includes files changed since the previous full backup                                          |
| Continuous Backup    | When data written to storage media, also asynchronously written to second location over the network |

### Hardening of Operating Systems
- Removal or disabling of unnecessary services, applications and network protocols to prevent vulnerabilities that can be exploited
- Configure host-based access control according to organisation security policies
- Ensure that default accounts e.g. guest accounts not in use are removed or disabled
- Ensuring password policy (password length, complexity and expiry) is defined
- Assign privileges to limit access to resources which will be audited to monitor attempts to access them

### 2-Factor Authentication
- Confirm user claimed identities using combination of two factors:
	- something they know
	- something they have
	- something they are

### Security Awareness Education Training
- Train users about common social engineering techniques can reduce success of malware

## Software Security
### Secure Software Development Life Cycle
> Framework that describes stages used by organisations to design, develop, test and implement software

**Key concepts**
- Flaw -> defect in design
- Bug -> defect in implementation
- Vulnerability -> Security-related software defect that can be exploited to effect undesired behaviour
- Error handling -> Ensure unintended and incorrect system behaviour securely handled
- Timely patching -> Security patches can reduce risk of organisation vulnerabilities being exploited by unauthorised users

### Development Security Operations (DevSecOps)
- Integrates developers and operations team to improve collaboration and productivity by automating infrastructure, workflows and continuously measuring application performance
- Unify software development and software operation

>**Key objective:**
>- secure and enforce security in DevOps process by shifting left and automating security controls
>- best practice to integrate security into DevOps is **automation of security controls**

### Cloud-Native Application Security
- Main consideration for cloud-native application security is it can reduce operation overheads to maintain hardware and software

## Cyber Defence
### Cyber Threat Intelligence
**Definitions**
- Data about threat actors and their motivations, intentions and methods that has been collected, processed, evaluated and analysed
- Produce output that can help in decision making and encompass how best to protect critical assets of organisation
- Helps organisations focus on their resources and attention on trending cyber threats with higher chance of success

**Objectives**
- Adopt risk-based approach
- Provide understanding of threats to organisation's assets with assessment of adequacy of defences and impact assessment on harm to assets
- Enables prioritization of deployment of limited resources in mitigating risks

#### Types of CTIs
| CTI         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Strategic   | Written in plain language without technical jargon and focuses on business risk<br> Help make informed decisions about security budgets, staffing levels and other strategic matters                                      |
| Tactical    | Focuses on adversaries' tactics, techniques and procedures to understand how threat actors are likely to attack organisation<br> (Consumed by defenders e.g. architects, administrators and security staff)               |
| Operational | Refers to actionable information regarding specific impending attacks against organisation<br> Mitigate attacks by removing attack patterns, fortifying defences.<br> May require infiltrating into hacker communications |
| Technical   | Refers to technical details of attacker's assets e.g. tools, command and control channels and infrastructure. <br> Differs from tactical CTI, focuses on hash of malware, IP address of C&C servers and rapid distribution and response.<br> Consumption of technical CTI should be automated                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

**Implementing a CTI Programme**
- Demonstrate return to investment of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) to management
- Always present business case from risk-based perspective and not solely from cybersecurity angle
- Important to maintain professional relations with peer organisations for intelligence sharing

**CTI Cycle:**
- Planning and Direction
- Collection
- Processing
- Analysis
- Dissemination
- Feedback

### Security Analytics
**Key Concepts**
- Classification
- Clustering
- Structured Data
- Unstructured Data
- Machine Learning
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning

### Red and Blue Teaming
- Red and Blue Team can strengthen each other's defensive and offensive tactics respectively during exercise

**Key Concepts**
- Indication of Compromise (IOC)
	- Piece of forensic data observed on network in log file, persistence facility or operating system likely to indicate malicious activity that can aid security operations or incident responders to detect breaches, malicious activity or other form of attacks
- Lateral Movement
	- Process of jumping machines to locate and access system with valuable data
- Command and Control (C&C)
	- Influence attacker has over compromised computer system they control
- Exfiltration
	- Extraction of information from target typically through covert channel
- Rules of Engagement (ROE)
	- Establishes responsibility, relationship and guidelines between Read Team, client, system owner and stakeholders required for engagement exercise
- Threat Emulation
	- Process of mimicking TTPs of specific target
- Threat Intelligence
	- Evidence-based knowledge, context, mechanisms, indicators, implications, actionable advice about existing or emerging threats to assets
- Tradecraft
	- Techniques and procedures of conducting covert operations typically associated with intelligence community

> **Pointers:**
> - Important to run exercises like penetration testing as part of cyber defence
> - Because organisations should assess effectiveness and adequacy of security controls implemented to secure critical assets
> - Digital forensic investigator must follow due process during an investigation as evidence may be tainted and considered as inadmissible in court
